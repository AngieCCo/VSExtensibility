[Check out the wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/VSExtensibility/wiki) for all Dev17 & 64-bit extension resources, but keep in mind it's a work in progress!

**Warning:** This release of Visual Studio has not been as extensively tested as regular release of Visual Studio. Specifically we don't recommend installing Dev17 side by side with an earlier version that you depend on to work. This version will also not be updated in place, we will provide new installers for updates.
