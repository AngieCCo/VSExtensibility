<p>The new extensibilty model for Visual Studio depends on a set of new nuget packages to provide APIs, build tooling, code generation and analyzers.</p>

<h2 id="microsoftvisualstudioextensibility">Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility</h2>
<p>Link: <TBD></TBD></p>

<p>This package contains the SDK APIs and utility libraries to help develop extensions using the out-of-process extensibility model. Every extension should include a reference to this package as a starting point.</p>

<h2 id="microsoftvisualstudioextensibilitybuild">Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.Build</h2>
<p>Link: <TBD></TBD></p>

<p>This package contains the build tooling, code generators that is necessary for extension metadata to be generated during build. Without this package, a compiled extension may not work correctly as it will not contain the necessary metadata files.</p>

<h2 id="microsoftvisualstudioextensibilityeditor">Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.Editor</h2>
<p>This package contains the editor related SDK APIs and utilities and is included as a dependency from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility</code>.</p>

<p>In future previews, we may have similar nuget packages that are not included as a required dependency but can be added as needed to provide APIs for certain feature areas such as debugger, source control.</p>
