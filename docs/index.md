# Welcome to the VisualStudio.Extensibility documentation

The VisualStudio.Extensibility SDK is a new framework for developing Visual Studio extensions currently in active development and is now made available as a preview, which you can download from []().

With the current preview, you can already develop a wide range of extensions to Visual Studio, from creating a simple command and exposing it in the IDE, to adding support for a new language, extending code or text editing functionality, exposing the functionality of a tool in the IDE, and more.

The new framework is designed to be fully asynchronous and keep extensions isolated, usually in a separate process. These design principles are critical for keeping the Visual Studio IDE responsive and stable, even if extensions themselves have problems.

We're actively seeking feedback and engagement. During the preview phase, the framework isn't code complete, and this preview phase is a great time to get community input to help us identify issues and opportunities. You can enter issues in our [public repo](https://github.com/microsoft/VSExtensibility/issues).

The new VisualStudio.Extensibility framework may ultimately replace the VS SDK. However, you can also develop with both frameworks in the same extension, if the functionality you are trying to use is not yet available in the new framework, or if you are updating an existing extension written with the existing VS SDK.

This site is your hub for all documentation for ongoing and upcoming VisualStudio.Extensibility projects.  Documentation is currently available for the following:

* Visual Studio.Extensibility SDK (see below)
* [Extensions to Language Server Protocol (LSP)](lsp/lsp-extensions-specifications.md) 

## Visual Studio Extensibility SDK

The following documentation describes:

* The general architecture of the new extensibility model
* How to take advantage of the new extensibility modelâ€™s APIs
* How to compile and debug an extension with the new model
* Resources and code samples to get started writing an extension with the new model

For future updates please bookmark our [announcements](announcements.md) page.
