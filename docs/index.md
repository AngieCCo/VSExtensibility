# Welcome to the VSExtensibility documentation

This site is your hub for all documentation for ongoing and upcoming Visual Studio extensibility projects.  Documentation is currently available for the following:

* Visual Studio Extensibility SDK (see below)
* [Extensions to Language Server Protocol (LSP)](lsp/lsp-extensions-specifications.md) 

# Visual Studio Extensibility SDK

The following documentation describes:

* The general architecture of the new extensibility model
* How to take advantage of the new extensibility modelâ€™s APIs
* How to compile and debug an extension with the new model
* Resources and code samples to get started writing an extension with the new model

For future updates please bookmark our [announcements](announcements.md) page.

## API Docs

The following two namespaces are primary extensibility surface provided by the SDK:

* [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility](new-extensibility-model/api/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.md)
* [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.Editor](new-extensibility-model/api/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.Extensibility.editor.md)

The following assemblies contain classes related to infrastructure and underlying implementation for the wrappers in the SDK:

* [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.Framework](new-extensibility-model/api/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.Framework.md)
* [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.Contracts](new-extensibility-model/api/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.Contracts.md)
* [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.EditorHostService](new-extensibility-model/api/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Extensibility.EditorHostService.md)
* [Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Query](new-extensibility-model/api/Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Query.md)
