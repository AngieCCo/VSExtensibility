## Usage

Once installed, the Sample Remote Command button will not be visible by default.
To make the button visible:
1. Open a solution that has a CSharp project
2. Add a .config file to the project

Once visible, the Command button can also be enabled / disabled by selecting different files
in the solution explorer. For example, selecting the newly added .config file will make the button
enabled. By selecting a different file the button will be disabled.
